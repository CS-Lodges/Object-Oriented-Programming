# Polymorphic Code

- The polymorphic code is firstly resolved in the parent and then in the child class.
- If the called behaviour is present in both the classes only then the code will be called to be polymorphic code.

## Early Binding

- The resolving of behaviour in the parent class.

## Late binding

- The resolving of behaviour in the child class.
- it is also known as dynamic binding.

## Upcasting

- child ko parent main lana is upcasting
- `Employee e = new CommissionEmployee()`

## Downcasting

- parent ko child main lana is downcasting.
- `CommissionEmployee e = new Employee()`

## downcasting and upcasting are possible in case of Inheritance only.
