# Polymorphism
- The programming in terms of  Parent Class.
- The generic Progrmming
- The General Coding
- Example
```java
// instead of this code
public void showDetails(Faculty F){
    F.display();
}
// we can use this generic code
public void showDetails(Object obj){
    obj.display();
}

```
# DownCasting
- For specific work , we have to do the specific work first and then write the general code
- for this purpose we use downcasting , in this one object is firstly used to get the required results and then generic code is written!
