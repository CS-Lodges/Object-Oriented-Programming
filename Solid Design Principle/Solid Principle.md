# Solid Principle

## `S` --> Single Responsibility Principle

```java
Every class will Perform its specific Duty!
You can perform two tasks in a single class but this is not a good practice!

```

## `O` --> Open Closed Principle

```java
The classes or entities are open for extensions (inheritance) but are closed for modifications!
The Modification can result in serious problems in code! Therefore it should be avoided!
```

## `L` -->

- `I` -->
- `D` -->
