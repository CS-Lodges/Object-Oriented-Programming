# Core-Object-Oriented-Programming
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.
***
## Abstraction 
- Abstraction is the process of picking out (abstracting) similar characteristics of procedures and objects.  

## Class 

- Class is categorizing objects. A class defines all the common traits of the numerous objects that fall under it. 

## Encapsulation 

- Encapsulation is wrapping the data under a single, consolidated unit. In OOP, it is defined as binding data with a function that manipulates it. 

## Inheritance 

- Inheritance is the ability of one class to derive its characteristics from another class. 

## Interface 

- Interface comprises the languages and the codes used by various applications to communicate with each other. 

## Object  

- Object is an entity that is self-contained. It consists of data as well as procedures. 

## Polymorphism 

- Polymorphism refers to a programming languageâ€™s ability to process objects uniquely according to their data type and/or class.
